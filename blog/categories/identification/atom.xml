    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Hey</h2>

<p>You seem to have stumbled upon this website, or &ldquo;blog&rdquo;. Let me assure you, this blog is not likely to be remotely useful to you.
This blog is almost entirely created to assist me in remembering how to use a computer in certain ways. If, however,
you also have an interest in computing that intersects with my own, there may be articles within this blog that will assist you.</p>

<h2>Types of Projects</h2>

<p>The main types of projects on this blog will be entirely software based and will either be derived from my experiences
as a computer science student, or from extra-curricular projects I have done on my own. Perhaps unsurprisingly (since they are my own)
I find all of these projects incredibly interesting, even when they aren&rsquo;t even close to being interesting. In case this is relevant,
the main languages in which I develop are:</p>

<p>C/C++ (I hate C++)
Python
Ruby
Perl
Javascript
Shell Scripting</p>

<p>and probably others, but these are definitely a relatively thorough selection of those with which I am most familiar.</p>
